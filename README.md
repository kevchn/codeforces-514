# codeforces-514
ICPC practice, week 1

More detailed comments in file headers.

Finished A - simple
Finished B - created complicated but still linear scheme for checking 
Finished C - whiteboarded nice recurrence solution... how to reduce # of base cases??
Partial implementation of D - missing minimum circles cover problem, maybe easier way to do this?
Thinking on E - seems like should be easy recursive problem?

Thoughts
- need to create c++ geometry library
- must create some baseline c++ implementations of common trees to drop in for solutions
